By definition, a computer program is a collection of instructions that are designed to perform a specific task. It is inherently important for a developer to understand each individual instruction or step the program has to take in order to reach its goal correctly. Naturally, it can be valuable to a developer to have more control over these instruction depending on the program at hand. When the program is executing some specific instruction, the collection of steps that still need to be processed in order for the program to complete a computation is known as a continuation. Some languages are able to provide its users this ability to treat continuations as first class features, while some other languages require its users to implement them manually. Regardless of the kind of program being created, continuations can always be a valuable concept and tool for a developer to understand in order to be equipped to build smart and sound programs.
